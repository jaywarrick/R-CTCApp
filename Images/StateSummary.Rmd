# State Summary

* Num. Yes: `r length(which(values$stateTable$No.Maybe.Yes == 2))` (`r round(length(which(values$stateTable$No.Maybe.Yes == 2)) / nrow(values$stateTable), digits=1`)
* Num. Yes: `r length(which(values$stateTable$No.Maybe.Yes == 2))`

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
